    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

        This HTML file provides a portfolio of the graphs I made during my datascience masterclass with the Economics Observatory.
        I learnt how to use vega-lite to edit graphs, github to keep these as json files, and visual studio to code HTML and CSS.
        Everything I've made on visual studio needs to be saved into a local folder on my laptop, and all the graphs are already on my github ready to be pulled from.
        From there I can upload my 'index' to github and this updates my website!

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->

            <h2>Literacy in India</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is a chart I saved from the economics observatory site. It's a heatmap displaying the literacy rate in India, by district. The highest literacy rates are seen in the South West of India.
            </p>

            <h2>GDP and Life Expectancy</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is another chart that is pulling directly from a html. 
                The chart shows the GDP and life expectancy of five continents.

            <h2>My GDP chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is a chart I've edited and added in myself by copying and pasting the vega-lite code into Github, downloading this and putting into my desktop file which is what I'm working into in Visual Studio (where I'm writing this now).

            <h2>My population heatmap</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                this is a heatmap I've made using economics observatory example data where I've replaced inactivity rates in an ITL3 level map with employment data.
                I'm not too sure what the year of the data is.
                But it shows that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have much lower population numbers.
